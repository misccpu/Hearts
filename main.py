# NOTE: Sort ordering for suits is as follows:  DIAMOND < CLUB < HEART < SPADE
#       Changing the macro will change the order everywhere, but may mess with AI a little...

# Updates:
# 12/12/21  -Cleaned up choose_card() by creating ai_choose_card() method. This moves the AI logic out of choose_card().
#           -Updated user_card in all 'choose' methods to be declared as a Card(). This prevents some confusing errors.
#           -Commented out a section of code that's supposed to remove the â™ Q if it's unsafe, but it was kinda buggy.
#           -Threw in some boolean if statements that print the AI's notes and/or WH and statuses that work most of the
#               time, which is good enough for me!
#           -Wrote the readme! Time for a break!
#
# 12/11/21  -Finished gather_game_data()
#           -Added variables to Game() to track if the user wants to see AI info or their working hands.
#
#           TODO:
#           -Add functionality to show AI info and working hands!
#           -Make clean up choose_card() by making more methods such as a method to eval statuses in WH!
#           -Sometimes if the AI is in make_a_decision() and has one out SPADE, but a low SPADE count, they'll play the
#               out and screw themselves if someone else plays a SPADE.
#
# 12/10/21  -Spent a lot of time fleshing out the AI decisions in choose_card(). Sometimes the AI knows that a high
#               card is safe when they shouldn't, but that's a consequence of gen_all_poss_tricks() playing ahead. See
#               next steps.
#           -The AI's use of make_a_decision() to choose a card in a hand of many suits and/or statuses is the fuzziest
#               part of the logic. When this function is called, the AI is either leading or void in the trick_suit, so
#               USUALLY the best play is to play the highest rank in the WH. Also, if there is a tie in rank, it will
#               probably choose the "highest" suit in order DIAMOND < CLUB < HEART < SPADE, but this is very rare.
#           -Created a number of 'choose'-type methods and other static helper methods to assist in making decisions.
#               I am somewhat ashamed of which_card_is_higher_rank(), but there isn't a way to compare naked ranks with
#               > or < that works correctly without making a Rank() class and overloading those magic methods, which
#               seems silly.
#           -Added self.game_over bool to Game(). Now play_the_game plays as many games as needed for someone to get to
#               100 points.
#           -Wrote a function to collect needed data from the user to play Hearts! Everything will be returned via tuple
#               and passed to Game() to build what it needs to play the game.
#
#           NEXT TIME:
#           -Finish gather_game_data().
#           -Add flags to Game() regarding whether or not the user wants to see AI notes or their WH or whatever and
#               make sure it works!
#           -Polish!
#
#           NEXT STEPS:
#           -After adding highest and lowest three cards of each suit to statuses (with appropriate updating), consider
#               removing tricks with data that occurs on a later player's turn from all_poss_tricks. Then the AI can
#               have a little more info to choose a card realistically, especially when leading where there is the least
#               amount of data.
#           -Use this engine to develop card weights for a stronger type of AI down the road.
#
#           TO DO:
#           -Make clean up choose_card() by making more methods such as a method to eval statuses in WH!
#           -Sometimes if the AI is in make_a_decision() and has one out SPADE, but a low SPADE count, they'll play the
#               out and screw themselves if someone else plays a SPADE.
#
# 12/09/21  -Moved human input processing into its own function get_human_input() so I can insert human input wherever I
#               find useful.
#           -Added the card played by the active player to the tuple storing poss trick info. Now it holds the card they
#               played, points in the trick, and who takes it.
#           -Fixed a bug in who_takes_the_trick() by changing the suit of the Card returned by the default
#               Card.__init__() to SUITS[0]. It was CLUB causing tricks of diamonds to not select the highest_card
#               properly.
#           -Began constructing an AI algorithm to be called from choose_card() by playing several games while looking
#               at all the stats.
#           -Added self.void_suits list to Player class. Also updated long suits to be 6 or more cards of a suit and
#               made that a list to match the others.
#           -Overhauled print_stats() to show useful info (like voids). Void suits may be important to AI! Same with
#               3 highest and lowest cards that are still unplayed (especially outs), but I'll probably add that later.
#           -Added a line in play_the_game() to only call gen_all_possible_tricks() if len(working_hand) > 1 so we don't
#               have to do all that extra work since choose_card() will always play the card if len(working_hand) == 1.
#           -Added statuses to Card objects. This lets AI assign a value to each card based on board state, etc. The
#               statuses are OUT, SAFE, and UNSAFE. Also made HIGH, but may not use it.
#           -Wrote eval_safety() to let AI assign statuses to cards in the working_hand. Refining.
#           -AI now chooses the best card if WH is all one suit. This takes care of many cases. The AI still has trouble
#               leading and what to play if void in the trick_suit. Once I write those cases, it should be able to
#               handle MOST situations...
#           -Wrote a number of helper methods to assist, and some more methods in Card for simple status manipulations.
#           -Formatting.
#           -Made a tiny algorithm that may be useful for teaching AI to lead and when void.
#
#           NEXT TIME:
#           -Teach AI how to lead and how to choose a card when void in the trick_suit. May just need to teach it how to
#               know when to choose a particular suit, and then a particular card status.
#           -Look at eval_safety():
#               -Do I believe that it needs to assign Card status differently if leading?
#               -Do I believe that it needs to assign Card status differently based on Game.suit_counts (dict)?
#
#           (Probably not enough time for anything else but also):
#           -Add tracking for three highest and three lowest cards in each suit.
#           Add records in Card class to track its status over the course of the game (very cool!).
#           Maybe add toppers and stoppers after implementing shooting the moon in the far future LOL
#
# 12/08/21  -Added a turn count parameter to gen_all_poss_tricks() to init hands correctly based on turn.
#           -Added a call to gen_all_poss_tricks() in play_the_game(). This also inits WHs correctly, so removed
#               the call to p.init_working_hand(). There is one small exception that may produce strange WH for non-lead
#               players if the WH aren't initialized again after a card is led; added a note in the func about that.
#               However, all players' WH are initialized before choosing a card, so no problems arise in the main loop.
#           -Rewrote count_all_points() to count shooting the moon correctly!
#           -Moved trick_suit and hearts_broken updates out of the main game loop and into update_game_records().
#           -Mucked around with some formatting.
#           -Rewrote who_takes_the_trick() because it was having issues finding the index in a list of Cards. It also
#               now requires the trick to evaluate to be passed in so it can be useful in more contexts.
#           -Added a line to update the working trick before attempting to gen_all_poss_tricks() in the main loop. Now
#               the tricks generated have earlier players' cards added correctly.
#           -Added functionality to gen_all_poss_tricks() that creates a list of tuples to store the value of the
#               tricks generated (i.e. points and who takes the trick).
#           -Created functions to print and clear all_poss_tricks.
#           -Even more formatting! I didn't end up using int_game_state_copy() that I made earlier... Might delete it!
#
#           NOW:
#           -Analyze books in all_poss_tricks for points and who takes it       DONE
#           -Use this data to think about how to lead
#
#           AI Thoughts:
#           Level 0 AI:     Never take/lead the queen of spades unless it's the only option.
#                           Avoid taking points.
#                           Tries to get rid of short suits.
#           Level 1 AI:     Randomly choose a card among the tricks that take no points. If all take points, choose a
#                           random card.
#           Level 2 AI:     Will play a high card if he gains no points.
#           Level 3 AI:     Plays high only if he has an out.
#           Level + AI:     Tries to shoot the moon! LOL
#
#           NEXT TIME:
#           Begin to implement AI       STARTED
#           Add tracking to Player for voids (no cards in a suit) to stats      DONE
#           Add tracking for the three highest cards and lowest cards in a suit. Low cards can be used as "outs".   SOON
#           Maybe add a "self.status" variable for each card to track their value over the course of the game.
#               Identify cards such as the highest and lowest cards ('out cards') in a suit that change as cards are
#               played, and over this many games it had this status this percent of the time... Data to weight cards!
#           Create a way to view card statuses once implemented.        DONE
#           Maybe add toppers and stoppers after implementing shooting the moon in the far future LOL
#           Tiny note: an out is only an out if it's not the last of its suit! *because it sees the future it knows this
#
# 12/07/21  -Created a recursive algorithm to populate a list of all possible tricks on a given turn. The proper amount
#               of tricks should be all players' hand counts multiplied together (i.e. 4*1*4*3 = 48 possible tricks).
#           -Fleshed out the recursive func some. Still gotta test!     I TESTED IT AND IT WORKS :D
#           -Increased recursion depth to 10000 so both gen_all_poss_tricks() and deepcopy are happy.
#           -LATER:
#           Flesh it out and test it!   DONE
#           Create a func to score each book for the player that originally called the recursive func
#           Update CPU_AI in choose_card to pick the best card
#           Much later, add tracking to value cards over many games
#           -TO DO:
#               Need to update scoreboard to score shooting the moon correctly!     DONE
#               Successfully move trick_suit and hearts_broken updates into update_game_records func.       DONE
#               After doing ^ above, update the recursive function to update and rewind game records.       NO, IT WORKS
#               Update print_all_poss_tricks to print points and the name of the player who will take it.   DONE
#               Another thing I could do is replace the two for loops in remove funcs with a while loop that only
#                   increments if something isn't removed, which would work, but would it really matter?    NAH
#
# 12/06/21  -Created init_game_state_copy for use in AI development. After doing some reading, developing an AI with
#               perfect board knowledge may be easier than an imperfect one, so making a copy of the board and playing
#               that turn through to find the best card to play each turn may be the right strategy!
#           -An approach of this manner uses brute force to find a value of a card after it's played. I wonder if it
#               could be used to collect data. Remember, the original idea was to play a data-based game LOL
#           -Plan A: build a recursive function that unrolls (?) the hand from an incremented player_list. Some sig
#               like Game.recursive_func_name(self, p, p_index, book, ...). Base case would be if it's the last player
#               in the list. Return the chosen card of p_index + 1. It may be a good idea to order the Player's
#               working_hands by size for a boundary.
#           -Plan B: create a method in Game() to build a list of all possible books for the hand, score them based on
#           who takes the trick, and return a list of cards to choose from (or just one card!)
#           -Plan C: Combine them! Maybe use the recursive method to populate the list of books (but could just use
#               nested loops, even though that isn't as cool as recursion). Recursion might not even work lol
#           -Also need to update scoreboard to score shooting the moon correctly!
#
# 12/05/21  -In choose_card, if there's only one legally playable card in working_hand, just return that card!
#           -Moved update_interface calls around in main loop to make output make more sense
#
# 12/04/21  -Perfected what I'd started yesterday: choose_card now accepts human input. Created a static method to
#               ensure good input; couldn't think of a reason to make it not static.
#           -Rewrote print_scoreboard to just print the dict; good enough!
#           -Reworked choose_card to make it more clear that it returns cards; only random ai wants an index
#           -Added a line to always print the current player's working hand during their turn when running a game
#           NEXT TIME:
#           -Convert the for loop at the beginning of play_the_game into a while that tracks player scores
#           -Change the scoreboard dict keys to accomplish the above entry
#           -Update scoreboard to score shooting the moon correctly
#           -Start coding some AI!! :) :) Use trees to look into the future to test playing different cards, then decide
#               what to play based on whether you want to take the trick or not, plus other settings! MiniMax?!     NOPE
#
# 12/03/21  -Changed ints in RANKS into strings, then updated the necessary magic methods and manually-crafted Cards
#               everywhere to accept this change.
#           -Got frustrated so I stopped LOL
#
# 12/02/21  -Rewrote who_takes_the_trick to work properly by removing cards from a working trick instead of whatever
#               else it was I was trying to do
#           -Created an AI stub class
#           -Added a list and a dict to Game class to track all cards and suits played
#           -Fixed a bug where play_the_game never broke hearts when it was supposed to
#           -Fixed an indexing bug in choose_card where the index would always be -1 and never be updated (why? idk)
#           -Renamed uses of 'Player' as an index variable to just p
#           -Reworked init_working_hand to account for the case where you lead, heart's aren't broken, and you happen
#               to have a hand full of hearts
#           -Added a counter for games played to track LOTS of games if needed
#           NEXT TIME:
#           -Add a way to play as a human (it might be helpful to only see the working hand when playing)
#           -Use update_interface() to call another function to scorekeep with an option to print the scores?
#           -Make another function to display the score at the end of the game
#
# 12/01/21  -Changed Card magic methods to reference SUITS macro; just changing macro order now changes order everywhere
#
# 11/30/21  -Haven't been keeping track, first started around 11/10/21. I did have a slightly broken play_the_game()
#               completed along with some rudimentary printing
#           -LOTS of debugging
#           -Cleaned up the interface printing, including printing the trick in a clockwise pattern.
#           -Paced the main loop, adding [ENTER] and printing the interface at important intervals
#           -Made use of \n
#           -Enabled printing player's books
#           -Fixed a bug in all 'remove' functions where it would only remove every other card that it was supposed to
#           -Removed function print_deck (why do you need it)
#           # Next time:
#           -need to fix who_takes_the_trick() to choose the correct card   DONE NOW
#           -maybe print the player's hands right next to the clockwise representation and mess with spacing? :)    NO
#           -add a list that tracks and counts played suits to calc odds for data and future ai     DONE NOW
